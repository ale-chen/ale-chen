- I spent several hours or so writing a short program to search differing upcoming American Football betting odds to find guaranteed Arbitrage profit opportunities between different bookmakers. As of the time of writing this (7:00 AM, Nov. 12), betting on the Sunday Bills v. Vikings game can yield a guaranteed .63% profit if you bet using both the BetMGM and BetFAIR platforms. *I am currently working on a project to relate sports-news (injury reports, weather) to time-series bet-pricing data, this should be finished around late February.
- The MLProjects repo contains several toy-datasets and a demonstration of profficiency with Python, sklearn, and a bredath of ML models.
- *AS OF 8 AM ON NOV 13, THERE'S A 9.72% GUARANTEED RETURN ON THE SAME GAME USING MYBOOKIEAG AND FANDUEL
