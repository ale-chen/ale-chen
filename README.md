- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, it's Alec--I didn't have a github profile prior to applying to the DSI clinic. However, I wanted to demonstrate that I had some proficiency in:
- I. Jupyter Notebooks II. Python
- So, I spent several hours or so writing a short program to search differing upcoming American Football betting odds to find guaranteed Arbitrage profit opportunities between different bookmakers. The only repo on this entire profile contains said program. As of the time of writing this (7:00 AM, Nov. 12), betting on the Sunday Bills v. Vikings game can yield a guaranteed .63% profit if you bet using both the BetMGM and BetFAIR platforms.
- *AS OF 8 AM ON NOV 13, THERE'S A 9.72% GUARANTEED RETURN ON THE SAME GAME USING MYBOOKIEAG AND FANDUEL
- Cheers! Thanks for the consideration.
